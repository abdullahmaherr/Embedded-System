# Embedded Systems Repository
Welcome to my embedded systems repository. This collection serves as a comprehensive documentation of my journey in mastering embedded systems, focusing on both practical projects and problem-solving exercises.

## C/C++ Problem Solving
This section includes a variety of problem-solving exercises designed to build proficiency in C and C++:
1. **Assignments**: Coursework and assignments focused on embedded systems concepts.
2. **Codeforces Challenges**: Solutions to algorithmic challenges on Codeforces using C and C++.
3. **Problem Solving**: General problem-solving exercises to strengthen logical and programming skills.
4. **Projects in C**: Practical projects implemented in C, demonstrating embedded systems applications.
5. **HackerRank Challenges**: Solutions to basic problem-solving challenges on HackerRank.

## Compilation Techniques
Detailed resources and scripts related to the compilation process for embedded systems:
1. **Makefile Setup**: Includes `Makefile`, startup code, and linker scripts essential for building embedded applications.
2. **ARM Cortex-M3**: Compilation details specific to ARM Cortex-M3, including a custom `Makefile`, C and Assembly based startup code, and linker scripts.

## Data Structures in Embedded Systems
Implementation of essential data structures tailored for embedded systems:
1. **Stack (LIFO)**: Implementation and applications of the Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack structure.
2. **Queue (FIFO)**: Implementation and usage of the First In, First Out (FIFO) queue structure.
3. **Linked List**: Efficient handling of dynamic data using linked list structures.

## Repository Goals
This repository aims to:
- Document my learning and development in embedded systems.
- Provide a structured approach to problem-solving using C and C++.
- Offer insights into the compilation process and data structure implementations specific to embedded systems.

## FreeRTOS
A tutorial series that demonstrates the fundamentals and advanced concepts of using FreeRTOS in embedded systems:
1. **Task Creation**: How to create and manage tasks in FreeRTOS, including priority management and scheduling.
2. **Task Communication**: Implementing queues, semaphores, and mutexes for inter-task communication.
3. **Memory Management**: Efficient dynamic memory allocation techniques in FreeRTOS.
4. **Interrupt Handling**: Integrating interrupt service routines (ISRs) with FreeRTOS tasks.
5. **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples and projects demonstrating the use of FreeRTOS in embedded applications.
